### Project 2: Web Scraping in Python from Canadian Prime Ministers Wikipage
- Although a lot of raw data is available in CSV, JSON, XML, and other "standard" formats, an awful lot of published data resides within webpages, embedded within HTML markup.  Developing strategies and techniques for extracting usable data from raw HTML is an important skill.

- This basic notebook will help me to improve and combine SQL and database skills, as well as writing more complex Python code.

- Despite we can absolutely use Pandas and other libraries for scraping data, I will use Soup in this project.

- There are three main parts in this project: 
   - 1. Create MariaDB database to store scraped data including create database, schema, table, view, user, grant access, 
   - 2. Use Soup to scrap the data from Wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_Canada
   - 3. Use the data in database to answer some questions provided in the notebook

- Now, let's get started [TanThienNguyen_Python_WebScraping_CanadianPrimeMinisters.ipynb](https://github.com/TanThienNguyenVN/Project2_Python_WebScraping_CanadianPrimeMinisters/blob/main/02_Python_WebScraping_CanadianPrimeMinisters.ipynb)
